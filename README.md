<h4>Q1.DijKstra Algorithm</h4>
<br>Code : Dijkstra's Algorithm

Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and<br> E number of edges.
Find and print the shortest distance from the source vertex (i.e. Vertex 0) to all other vertices (including source vertex also)<br> using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Print the ith vertex number and the distance from source in one line separated by space. Print different vertices in different<br> lines.<br>
Note : Order of vertices in output doesn't matter.<br>
Input Format :<br>
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)<br>
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex<br> ej <br>with weight wi (separated by space)<br>
Output Format :<br>
In different lines, ith vertex number and its distance from source (separated by space)<br>
Constraints :<br>
2 <= V, E <= 10^5<br>
